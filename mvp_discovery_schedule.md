## Team Intros
Introduce the team, have everyone give a brief background.

* Name:
* Role on the team:
* Role during the MVP Discovery process (if any) 



## MVP Discovery Introduction:
> Day one of the MVP Discovery is about gathering all existing information/knowledge on the business, the customer and the problem and exposing our assumptions and knowledge gaps. From here we can make plans to fill the riskiest knowledge gaps and validate or invalidate our riskiest assumptions.
> 
> Throughout **Day 1** we should be working on defining what the business will be, who is going to be using the product, and how this product is solving a problem that those users have. What are the situations in which users will be using the product or feature? What are their motivations behind using it? What are any outside motivators that might affect their use? The whole team should think about what product success looks like and what success looks like for the sprint.
> 
> The team should also talk about what they don't know -- where there are knowledge gaps for the problem. As all of those are being defined assumptions that. The team should cover existing research done before the sprint and review analysis of competitive products.
> 
> At the end of **Day 1** the team should have captured the critical path for the problem.

**As you work through the Understand phase of a sprint there will be a lot of questions that come up and information that is uncovered. Ask obvious questions and embrace the beginner's mind.**


## Problem Statement
It is best to identify the job-to-be-done that the sprint is trying to solve as early in the process as possible. Identifying the problem will help to determine if there is a problem, if that problem is solvable, and how to solve that problem. This step will be the first step to answering this question: What is this product, and is it useful?

1. The facilitator leads discussion by writing statements on the whiteboard for everyone to see.
2. Write down all of the potential problems that the user has *(pare down to one succint statement at the end later)*.
   * What are all the jobs to be done?
   * What is the problem that this product is going to solve?
   * What is the motivation behind what the user wants?
3. As a group decide which problem is the most critical.
4. Continue to refine language around the Problem Statement until we have a **clear and succint one-sentence Problem Statement (keep jargon to an absolute minimum).**
5. Leave the statement in a clear, visible spot in the room so that it is easy to reflect back on.

## Competitors and Similar Services
At this time the Product Owner should present their competitors in the space. Team members should also present any similar services that they know of.

Knowing what products currently exist helps us to determine potential features, revenue models, and marketing efforts.

**Discuss:**

1.  Where competitors are excelling. *What do they do well?*
2.  Where competitors are failing. *What gaps are they leaving open? What market is untouched?*
3.  What is our products competitive advantage? *Price? Features? Niche markets?*


## Identify Client and End User

The product that we build should serve the needs of real people with real problems, but often the needs of those paying for the product are different from the needs of those using the product. 

The business, organization, or person who purchases the product is called the **Client**. It is important to define their needs and motivations, as it will influence the:

* Marketing and copy of the product's front facing website.
* Pricing model.
* Feature Set.

The actual person who uses the product is the **End User**. Identifying their needs and motivations will influence:

* The language inside the product.
* Feature set.


> E.G. **Product X** is a writing application that helps students create better short stories. The school or district that purchases the product would be the **Client**, while the students actually using the software would be the **End Users**.

### The Client
* What type?
  * Organization
  	* What type of organization? 
  	  * *For profit, non-profit.*
  	* How many employees?
  	* Demographics (Nationality, Location, Income, Revenue Model)
  * Individual
  	* Demographics (Age, Occupation, Nationality, Gender, Location, Income)
* What problem are we solving for the client?
* How are existing services not serving their needs or solving their problems?
* How much are they realistically willing to pay for the product?
* Will they pay use the product continually, or will they more likely only use it once?

### The End User
* Demographics (Age, Occupation, Nationality, Gender, Location, Income)
* What problem are we solving for the End User?
* How are existing services not serving their needs or solving their problems?
* Will they use the product continually, or will they more likely only use it once?

## Define the Critical Path
Once completed, the Critical Path should give a step-by-step map of the user's most critical experience, from having the problem to solving the problem, and every step in between.

The purpose of choosing a Critical Path is so that we invest the majority of our energies into the most important part of the project. There are are a lot of important decisions that go into creating a great product, but **at this stage of the project it's very important that we focus on the features that give the highest return on our time investment**. It's easy to get lost in the weeds of a project, but staying on task at this stage is necessary when creating a great product.
